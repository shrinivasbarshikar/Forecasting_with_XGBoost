# Forecasting_with_XGBoost
This project demonstrates how to use XGBoost for forecasting tasks, such as time series prediction. It guides you through the necessary steps, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, using XGBoost to predict future values based on historical data.
## 1. Introduction
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm that performs well for both regression and classification tasks. It is widely used for structured/tabular data problems. In this project, we focus on forecasting, where we predict future values based on historical data.

XGBoost has proven to be effective in handling time series forecasting tasks due to its ability to model complex patterns and its high performance in various machine learning competitions.

## 2. Installation
To use XGBoost for forecasting, you'll need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
xgboost
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
